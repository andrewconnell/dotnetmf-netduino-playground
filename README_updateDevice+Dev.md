Updating the Netdunio Plus 2 to .NET Micro Framework v4.3.1.0 (VS2013)
============================

First had to install special versions of the .NET MF SDK & Netduino SDK for v4.3.1 + QFE1 for VS2013... downloads and instructions here: [http://forums.netduino.com/index.php?/topic/10201-experimental-visual-studio-2013-support/](http://forums.netduino.com/index.php?/topic/10201-experimental-visual-studio-2013-support/)

See this page for more information & instructions: [Netduino Plus 2 Firmware v4.3.1](http://forums.netduino.com/index.php?/topic/10479-netduino-plus-2-firmware-v431/)

I had to download & install the STDFU drivers | tools v3.0.3... this is in the folder *dfusedemo_3.0.3*, then I could run the Netduino updater in the folder *NetduinoUpdate_4.3.1.0*.
> Make sure to install the amd64 installer... not the other one. Once I did this, when the Netduino was connected, in *Device Manager* it was listed as **Universal Serial Bus Controllers > STM Device in DFU Mode**
