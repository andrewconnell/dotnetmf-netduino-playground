#SimpleRgbLed

First time using RGB LEDs. Demonstrates how to use the MSFT SPOT namespace as well as the Netduino Secret Labs libraries which make it a bit easier to work with PWN (pulse) devices.

*From Chapter 6 of [Getting Started with Netduino](http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Started-Netduino-Chris-Walker-ebook/dp/B007AU3D2U)*
