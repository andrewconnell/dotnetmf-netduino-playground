.NET Micro Framework & Netduino Playground
============================
Collection of .NET Micro Framework samples for the Netduino. Contains notes & samples for testing various sensors and capabilities on the Netduino.

## Updating Netdunio Plus 2 & Dev Env > .NETMF 4.3.1+QFE1 & VS2013
By default all the instructions and downloads are for the .NET Micro Framework 4.2.* and Visual Studio 2012. I wanted to use the latest firmware & Visual Studio 2013. Instructions, notes & download links that I used are all found in the [README_updateDevice+Dev.md](README_updateDevice+Dev.md) file.
